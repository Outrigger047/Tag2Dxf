# Tag2Dxf
Tag2Dxf is a project for deserializing Taglio TAG files and converting them to AutoCAD DXF. TAG is a closed proprietary format, although the files are encoded as plaintext. There aren't any programs that can read them other than Taglio LogoTag (as far as I am aware), and Taglio provides no publicly-facing tools to do bulk conversions.
