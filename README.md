# Tag2Dxf
Tag2Dxf is a project for deserializing Taglio TAG files and converting them to AutoCAD DXF. TAG is a closed proprietary format, although the files are encoded as plaintext. There aren't any programs that can read them other than Taglio LogoTag (as far as I am aware), and Taglio provides no publicly-facing tools to do any sort of automatic conversions other than loading the TAG files one by one in their flagship CAD application and saving them as DXF by hand.

The objective of this project was to create a small utility that could do these conversions in bulk. The command line interface can take a directory and a recurse argument as parameters in order to process lots of TAG files across multiple directories. The current TAG file model implemented here is not all-encompassing. In its current state there are many TAG elements that will be ignored. The practical application of this project was to convert files containing cutout shapes for kitchen and bathroom sinks. These files only leverage a small portion of the TAG file encoding space, so we are really just dealing with simple geometry (e.g. arcs, lines, points) and their most necessary attributes (e.g. color, line style, weight).
